This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data = read_csv("compas-scores-two-years.csv")

```


Renaming Columns

```{r}
data = data %>% rename(Sex = sex,
                Age = age,
                Race = race,
                Is_recid = is_recid,
                Recidivism_score = decile_score...40,
                Score_text = score_text,
                Violence_score = v_decile_score,
                Priors = priors_count...49)
```


Selecting relevant columns for analysis
```{r}
data = data %>% select(Sex, Age, Race, Is_recid,Recidivism_score,Violence_score, Priors, Score_text)

```


Data o
```{r}
str(data)
unique(data$Race) #looking at different races in dataframe

ggplot(data, aes(x = Race)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Representation of each Race in the Dataset", 
       x = "Race", 
       y = "Number of Individuals")

```
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Recidivism_score)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "grey", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Scores", x = "Score", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

```
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Race, y = Recidivism_score)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Recidivism Scores by Race",
       x = "Race",
       y = "Recidivism Score") +
  theme_minimal()

```
```{r}

high_risk = data %>% filter(Score_text == 'High') %>%
  group_by(Race) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

summary_data <- data %>%
  filter(Score_text == 'High') %>%
  group_by(Race) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_High_Risk = n(),
    Total_Recidivism = sum(Is_recid, na.rm = TRUE)
    )

summary_data %>% mutate(percent_recid = Total_Recidivism/Total_High_Risk)

  
 
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
